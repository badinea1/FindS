# CSC 426 Project 2: Find-S Algorithm Implementation, Experiments, and Analysis
# Authors: Amulya Badineni, Michael Giordano, Rishi Konkesa, Jason Swick
# Filename: README.md
# Description: Describes the contents of the submission.

This repository contains a Python based Find-S Algorithm Implementation.

## Contents
The repository includes three main deliverables:
  1. **main.py** & **train.py**: our source code 
  2. **Histogram & Descriptive Statistics.pdf**: contains a frequency histogram for the Experimental Question in Task 3 and a data table of numerical results for the Experimental Question in Task 3.
  3. **Reflection**: a writeup that addresses the following:
       1. anything positive we enjoyed or learned from this assignment,
       2. anything negative we didn't like about this assignment,
       3. any parts of this assignment we found easy,
       4. any parts of this assignment we found challenging or couldn't get working correctly,
       5. Details on how our team functioned

**NOTE**: The output trace our program produces for Task 2 will be shown in the terminal.
     
## Build Instructions for the HPC
1. Method 1: Cloning repository

```
module add python
git clone https://github.com/badinea1/FindS.git && cd FindS
python main.py

```


2. Method 2: 
On OnDemand, go to your File Home Directory and upload "main.py" and "train.py". Then, in the HPC terminal, enter: 

``` 
   module add python
   python main.py
```
