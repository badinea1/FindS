# Description: A writeup reflecting on the assignment.

(1) Anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment
	- We enjoyed being able to work together as a team to implement the Find-S algorithm. 
	We liked being able to apply what we learned in class and design a machine that could learn based 
	on data given to it. Working together allowed us to bounce ideas off each other so if we ever got stuck, 
	we would be able to talk about our problems and arrive at the correct solution.

(2) Anything negative you didn't like about this assignment
	- Nothing
	
(3) Any parts of this assignment you found easy
	- We thought that the assignment was very straightforward as the instructions were unambiguous 
	on what was expected. The Find-S algorithm took some time to implement, but we could complete it 
	after debugging and taking advice from each other.
	
(4) Any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly
	- The main part of this assignment that was difficult was generating the random examples for task 3. 
	We had to spend a decent amount of time coming up with a way to create the random samples, and then we 
	had some issues with implementing them in python. Learning python also posed some challenges as we never 
	had any formal learning experience in class, so everything we know had to be self-learned for this project.
	
(5) how your team functioned, including details such as what each team
member contributed, how the team communicated with each other, and how
team software development & design was accomplished
	- Our team functioned well together and practiced excellent communication, professionalism, and responsibility. 
	By working together and encouraging a culture of collaboration and constructive feedback, we were able to efficiently 
	and effectively execute all parts of the project. The initial stages of our project required an inception meeting on 
	Zoom where we decided what the project lifecycle would be and, at this point, established what the responsibilities
	and goals of each team member are. By utilizing Live Share (a visual studio feature) to code our project, we were able 
	to peer program effectively. At the beginning of the project timeline, we each decided to develop pseudocode for the project. 
	When we met to peer program, we critiqued one another designs and began programming. In regards to the final product, 
	Amulya and Michael constructed the Find-S algorithm and implemented the trace. Jason and Rishi constructed the random 
	example generation and implemented the experimental function. As a unit, we developed unit tests and implemented the main. 
	With the use of this peer programming style, we were able to quickly answer questions and receive feedback. If we had 
	programmed individually, the program would have taken longer to implement as one. 

(6) Any other remarks you want to make
	- Overall this was a very fulfilling experience. Applying a classroom learning experience to an actual application 
	drove home the concepts in an unforgettable manner.
