creates a string array full of all NULLs for S
prints out array of all NULLs

find s function(){

				replace NULL in S with value in input
			}//end if

				replace value in S with ?
			}//end else if
		}//end for loop
	}//end if
	output S
}//end find s


if(int task = 1){
	for(all data entries in file){		
		takes input from file to create an array of strings for data entry
		runs find s function	
	}//end for
}end if

else if(int task = 2){
	for(runs a certain number of times based off user input){
		while(target concpet is not found){
			for(each attribute){
				generate a random number based on the number of choices for that attribute
				assign that number to a different string in an array of strings for the random smaple
			}//end for
			Run find S 
		}//end while
		//Here will be some code either to output the nnumber fo tries to the screen or a file or something
